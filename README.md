## About The Project

In order to strengthen my front-end development skills, I am completing 50 projects that use HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Feel free to take a look at the individual projects by using the folders located in the repo

I will be following the Udemy course "50 Projects in 50 Days" by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop
